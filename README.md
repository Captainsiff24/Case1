# Acorns in Robo-Advising

## Overview and Origin
- Acorns
- Launched in 2012
- by Father son duo, Walter Wemple Cruttenden III and Jeffrey James Cruttenden
- The idea came from wanting to provide simplified portfolio options to people. The portfolio options were designed in in a partnership with Harry Markowitz, a paid advisor.
- The company has raised around $100 million dollars in venture capital. Most of these funds coming from investors wanting a return from an investment account.

## Business Activities
-Current financial issues the company is facing include the major hit the stock market is taking right now. Other problems the company is facing include some app problems and bug fixes in their models.
- The intended customer for the company includes anyone who wants to start investing. Big names like Kevin Durant, Jennnifer Lopez, and Ashton Kutcher are big time investors. Acorns really wants to attract early to middle aged consumers who are a little more established but do not want to pay the added fees of a financial advisor. They give the consumers with little to no knowledge in investing a chance to warm up to the market risk. Competitors like Sofi and Wealthfront offer low to none in management fees and offer counseling on their portfolios. Wealthfront also makes you maintain a minimum account balance of $500, not relly intended for starting investors. Acorns really stands out from the competitors because they were able to do early advertising to consumers with big names as mentioned prior. People trust these names in a sense that Acorns is able to maintain customer loyalty.
-A big piece of Acorns success is the robo-advising feature. Consumers can determine their own risk appetite and choose whether to take a high risk approach for a high return, or a less risky approach for a lesser dividend. Acorns provides micro investing, which invests users "Spare Change" in round up purchasing to make it simple for people to put money in their accounts for the up and coming. They do this by linking to your bank accounts and credit cards, free to download but will cost around $15 a year. They also provide the user with "found money" options, with partner companies of Acorns, that give back to the user by investing money in their portfolio if they shop with them.

## Landscape
- Acorns has a domain between investment banking and robo-advising. They go by the slogan "Invest, Earn, grow, spend later". Major trends and innovations include micro investing and portfolio management. Consumers can now receive automatic round-up transfers with the Acorns debit card. Which gives the consumer a taste of investing without forking out large sums of money. Doing this instead of having to wire money through third-party banking systems makes it easier for Acorns to transfer the money into investment accounts instead of having a delay. Ameriprise is a major competitor in the industry with Bloomberg ranking them high in gender equality and #252 on the Fortune 500. 

## Results
- The company has impacted thousands of people seeking a return on their investment portfolios, and also giving them the option of setting a retirement account without having to pay a monthly annuity. Acorns uses six different exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investments are diversified across 7,000 stocks and bond, and Acorns will rebalance your account to stay in your target allocation. Acorns also gives you accessibility to your account through your mobile phone or computer. They also provide you with found money partners that give you the chance to earn while you shop. Acorns does make clients aware all investments involve risk, including the loss of principle. Any reference to past performance, regarding financial markets or otherwise, do not indicate or guarantee future results.

## Recommendations
Acorns is a pretty diversified company, they only offer 7 different portfolio options. They could add selective options that you could use to create your own portfolio. Options could include your own pie chart that invests more into bonds and real estate and less in blue chip stock, or allow the user to choose what real estate, bond, or stocks their monetary investment contributes to buy.
This will give the individual more clarity on what they are investing in, and also give the company more transparancy to its consumer. In turn it will encourage more people to invest with the Acorn platform and educate investors more on the market and enhance their investing capabilities.
The company would have to provide more investment banking technology, and give consumers direct access to the information provided by the robo advisor so they do not make investments that could overall risk their entire investment. Consumers would need to have their own knowledge of personal finance if they are seeking to manage their own retirement account. Technologies along with live personel will be needed in order for the innovations to work properly.
